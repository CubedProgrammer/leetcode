BÃ©zout's identity tells us that for two numbers m and n, let k = gcd(m, n), am+bn=ck for some integers a, b, and c.
Moreover, this is true for all integers a and b, and there exists two values for a and be such that c=1.
This can be extended to three or more numbers, which is exactly the problem we have.
Perform reduce on the array using gcd and check if it is one.
