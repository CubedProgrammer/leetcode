Create a palindrome using the first half of the number, rounding up.
If it is bigger than the original number, create another palindrome that is smaller, and vice versa.
To create the other palindrome, increment or decrement the first half of the number by one.
Then copy the digits after in reverse order, beware of carrying or borrowing around powers of ten.
Return the closer palindrome.
If the number is already a palindrome, first check if it is a single digit, if so return the previous number.
Then, subtract and add one from the middle and copy the most significant digits in reverse order to the right.
Again beware of carrying or borrowing.
