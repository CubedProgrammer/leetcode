Loop through the array with a binary search tree.
The binary search tree will contain the numbers in a subarray of length indexDiff + 1.
After inserting an element, check if it is already in, if not, check if the element before and after are in range.
If not, continue looping through the array. If the conditions are never met, return false.
To build this tree, while looping through the array, if the index is bigger than indexDiff, remove nums[i - indexDiff - 1].
Then insert current element into the tree.
Before the loop, insert a very small number and a very large number into the tree.
This is so every element has an element before and after, the integer minimum and maximum should work.
