The problem can be decomposed by breaking the number into its digits.
Then, starting from the least significant digit, the ones digit, if it's at least a 1, then add one to the total.
Move to the digit to the left, since there is 1 one between 0 and 9, add the digit to the total.
Then, we have to consider when the tens digit of a number is one.
If the tens digit of the number is more than 1, add 10 to the total, since there are 10 numbers 10 to 19.
The ones digit in 11 was already counted in the ones digit step.
If the tens digit is exactly 1, then the numbers 10 to n%100 must be counted, there are n%10+1 numbers between 10 and n%100.
Then, move left to the hundreds digit, there are 20 ones in all the numbers 0 to 99, add the digit times 20 to the total.
Again, if the digit is more than 1, add 100, for 100-199, if it is exactly 1, add n%100+1.
The process repeats.
The number of ones between 0 and 9 is 1, the number of ones between 0 and 99 can be computed easily.
There are 10 blocks of 0 to 9 between 0 and 99, so there are 10, then another 10 from 10 to 19.
The number of ones between 0 and 999 can be computed similarly.
There are 10 blocks of 0 to 99, so there are 10*20=200, then another 100 from 100 to 199.
To calculate the number of ones between 0 and 10^k-1, multiply the previous total by 10, then add 10^(k-1).
Note the k starts at 0, so the first count is the number of ones between 0 and 0, which is obviously 0.
Using 6174 as an example.
1 one for 4.
For 70, 7*1=7, +10 because 7 is more than 1, for a total of 18.
For 100, 1*20=20, +74+1 because 1 is exactly 1, for a total of 113.
For 6000, 6*300=1800, +1000 because 6 is more than 1, for a total of 2913.
