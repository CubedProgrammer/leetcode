Create a vector of vertical lines from the buildings, they may be represented as tuples of position, height, left/right.
This vector needs to be sorted, but first, we have to think about tiebreaks for when two lines have the same position.
We will be looping through the vertical edges of the buildings left to right, and connecting dots.
If two left edges have the same position, we want to connect the previous point to the higher of the two edges.
If two different types of edges have the same, we want to encounter the left one first.
Otherwise, we may incorrectly connect to a point too low, if the left edge is higher than the current highest building.
If two right edges have the same position, we want to see the lower one first.
This way we cannot connect the higher one to the lower one.
After sorting the vector, we need a multiset to store the heights, so we know where to connect.
Initially, put a zero in the multiset.
Loop through the vector of vertical edges.
If the edge is a left edge, connect to its top if it is the highest building.
Add it to the set whether or not it is the highest, also use the set to check if it is the highest.
If it is a right edge, remove one instance of its height from the multiset.
Then, check if its height is higher than all the remaining buildings, if it is, connect to the highest remaining.
Connect means to record a point on the skyline.
