This problem requires the use of a sparce table.
Make a table for the maximum of ranges of size 2, 4, 8, and so on, up to k, for every starting index.
So index 0 would have maximum of indices of 0 and 1, then 0 through 3, then 0 through 7 and so on.
Then, for every index i, the maximum between i, inclusive, and i+k, exclusive, do the following.
Let m be the greatest power of 2 less than k, query the table for the range [i,i+m-1] and [i+k-m,i+k-1].
The maximum of those two is the maximum of the desired range at index i.
Example: n = 9, k = 6
2 3 9 1 6 7 4 8 5
Building the table, we get:
3 9 9 6 7 7 8 8
9 9 9 7 8 8
4 is the largest power of 2 less than 6, now we query for ranges of size 6.
9 9 9 8
