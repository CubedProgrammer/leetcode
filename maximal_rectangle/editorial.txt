Create a prefix sum array along one dimension of the matrix, except reset the sum at zero.
For example
10100
10111
11111
10010
becomes
10100
10123
12345
10010
Each cell stores how many consecutive ones are before it, including itself.
Then run the largest rectangle in histogram algorithm along the other dimension.
In this case, run it on every column, the largest rectangle in all the columns is the answer.
