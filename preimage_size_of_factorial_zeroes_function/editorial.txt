Build an array starting from 1, the next element is the previous multipled by 5, plus 1.
Take the number k, go through the array in descending order, if k is -1 mod the current number, return 0.
Otherwise, repeat with the next number with the remainder of k divided by the last number.
If you get to one, return 5.
Example k=60
The array goes 1, 6, 31, 156, ...
60 mod 31 is 29, keep going.
29 mod 6 is 5, so return 0;
