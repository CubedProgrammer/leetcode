Each file will have one queen.
Make an array of size n, the ith element of the array indicating the position of the queen in file i.
Go through the array, check if the queen in the current file attacks any queen in any previous files.
If it does, move the queen down and repeat, otherwise, move on to the next file.
If the final file is reached and no queens attack, add this position to the list of positions.
Remember to still move the queen in the final file down to not stay in one position.
If a queen in a file is at the bottom, move it back up to the top and move the queen in the previous file down.
Unless that queen is in the first file, then we are finished.
