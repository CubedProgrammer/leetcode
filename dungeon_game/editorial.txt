We will check if a certain amount of health, x, can survive.
If we know the most health remaining at a certain cell, we do not care about the path, it is irrelevant.
We can find the least damage required to get from that cell, to the destination, the sum would be the minimum damage taken.
This is clearly a dynamic programming problem. Have the matrix store the most health remaining to get to the cell.
For each cell, if the most health remaining is unknown, it is the value of that cell plus the maximum of the top and left.
The heath at the top left is just its own value, plus the initial health.
For example, with a starting health of 6
-1 -3
-2 -4
Should become
5 2
3 -1
The bottom right is -1 because it is -4, the value of that cell, plus the maximum of the top cell and left cell.
In this case, maximum of 3 and 2 is 3.
Since the bottom right is -1, we do not survive.
To take care of the case where we die in the middle, set the value to a really low negative number.
This will ensure no path through that cell is ever considered again.
