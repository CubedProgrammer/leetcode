Shove all the edges inside a binary search tree.
The binary search tree will ensure the path is lexicographically least.
Recursively search the graph depth-first, remove a flight after it has been traversed.
If a path is unsuccessful, meaning there are flights remaining but the current location is a dead end, return false.
If a recursive call on one flight returns false, try the next flight, if all flights are false, return false.
Make sure to add the flight back to the graph after it fails.
Also make sure to add the visited cities to a vector, and pop the back when flights fail.
