This problem is about peaks and valleys.
A valley is a position in the array such that both its adjacent elements are greater than its own element.
However, to deal with equivalent elements, the requirement will be strictly greater for left, and greater equal for right.
Valleys are important because they can be assigned one candy.

Find the first valley, then from the first valley, find the next valley.
Assign 1 to the first valley and keep track of the number of candies handed out previously, call this value k.
If the element to the right is greater, increase k by 1, if it is equal, reset k by 1.
Move to the right until the element to the right is less, this will be the peak.
Then start from the second valley and move left, reset the value of k, and increase or reset k like before.
Stop at the peak, the number of candies at the peak should be the larger of the two candy counts.
For example, if k is 10 at the peak from the left, and k is 12 from the right, assign the larger, 12, to the peak.

Make sure not to negelect the region from the beginning to the first valley, and from the final valley to the end.
Sum the array for the total amount of candy.
