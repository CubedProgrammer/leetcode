The sum of k consecutive numbers is of the form kn + k * (k - 1) / 2 for some integer n.
The k + k * (k - 1) / 2 is the minimum requirement for the number, n must be at least 1.
We can loop until the above is larger than the number given, and increment a counter when a number matches the form.
We can check using modular arithmetic.
