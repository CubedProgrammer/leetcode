Create two arrays to store the previous lesser element and next lesser element.
To build these arrays, create a stack, loop through the heights array.
Remove from the stack until it is empty or the top element is less than current element.
The previous lesser element will be at the top of the stack, record it in the array, or -1 if stack is empty.
Do the same for the next lesser element, loop backwards instead, and use heightsSize if stack is empty.
Do note that we don't store the values themselves in the stack or either of the two arrays, but the indices.
After both arrays have been built, loop through all the heights, query the previous and next lesser indices.
The width of the rectangle is next - previous - 1, the height is the height of the bar. Find the maximum of all of these.
