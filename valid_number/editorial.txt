Loop over the string and keep tabs on which part of the number you are in.
If there is an E, change to exponential part, unless already at exponential, then return false.
If there is a period, change to fractional part, if not at integral part, then return false.
Make sure the signs only appear where they are allowed.
Also make sure there are digits before and after the e.
