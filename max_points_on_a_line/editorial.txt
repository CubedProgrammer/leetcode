Do a nested for loop over every possible unordered pair of points.
Calculate the line Ax+By=C, and store A, B, and C in a tuple, store the tuple in a frequency table.
After the loop, find the highest value in the frequency table, it will be the answer choose 2.
Just make sure that there is more than one point before running this algorithm.
