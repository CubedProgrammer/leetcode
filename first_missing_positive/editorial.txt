Loop through the array.
Let n be ths length of the array.
If the number in the current position is outside the range [1,n], set the value to -1.
If the number in the current position is incorrect, that is, it is not `index + 1`, swap it to the correct position.
For example, if the number is 4, swap it to index 3, if the number is 9, swap with index 8.
If the number in the correct position is a duplicate, set the value in current position to -1.
Otherwise, swap until the number in the current position is correct.
After the loop is finished, all numbers are in the correct positions and are unique.
Return the index of the first -1, plus one, or n+1 if -1 is not present in the array.
The array may end up looking like this [1,2,-1,4,5], the index is 2, 2+1=3, so 3 is returned.
