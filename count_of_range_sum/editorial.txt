Prefix sum array the numbers, then perform merge sort on the new array.
Except before the merge, binary search for the right half in the left half.
Specifically, for every element in the right half, find how many sums in the left half are in range.
Since they need to be subtracted, let M be a value in the right half.
Look for numbers in the range of [M - upper, M - lower].
Beware of overflow.
