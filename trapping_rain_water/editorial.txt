Another monotonic stack problem.
Build the arrays for next greater or equal element and previous greater or equal element.
Loop forwards in the height array, keep track of height of previous great element.
Rain will be collected from the current great element to the next element greater or equal to the current.
Repeat until last largest element. Then loop backwards towards the last largest element and do the same in reverse.
